### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nazar, I'm a Junior Frontend Developer and I'm happy to see you here!

You can find numerous repositories named "**Lesson...**" - those are created during a C# course. 

**FinalProject** is the final C# course project that I've built with ASP.NET Core MVC + EF Core + MSSQL.

**LoggingAPI** is a small ASP.NET-based API (Docker, MongoDB) which I've built during my first employment.

You can most likely find the frontend study projects deployed on Netlify on my website: https://nazzz328.netlify.app/
